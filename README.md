# Rust-Queue-Skip
This bot will get you into any server as soon as it wipes. Dont buy queue skip anymore.


This bot spams your preferred connect command into the F1 console on the game rust.

You can either compile/build it yourself if you have visual studio or use the release.

How to use without building:
-Click code on the top right of the repo
-Select "download zip" and extract it
-Open the folder and navigate to the release folder (rustQueueSkipForms>bin>Release)
-Set your connect command in the server.txt
-Open rust and the f1 console
-Alt tab back into the release folder
-Run rustQueueSkipForms.exe
-Alt tab back into rust with the f1 console already open
-It will pause for 10 seconds allowing you to alt tab into rust with the f1 console open
-Let it run

IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE BOT FROM RUNNING HOLD ON BACKSPACE UNTIL IT STOPS

if you have visual studio, im sure you know how to build it.
